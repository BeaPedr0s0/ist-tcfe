\section{Conclusion}
\label{con}

\par As discussed in the introduction, the main goal of this assignment was to project a bandpass filter using an OP-AMP. which should  allow maximum voltage gain, spending the less possible on the components used, among the ones available.

\par Despite strong efforts to match the results obtained in the different analysis, it was concluded that, due to the non-linearity of the components of the circuit, particularly the OP-AMP, it was impossible to obtain the exact same quality using both tools. In fact, the complexity of the parameters of the amplifier used in ngspice, are impossible to be replicated in the theorical analysis. This is believed to be the main reason for the diferrent output of the circuits.

\par Nevertheless, once the ngspice model is the most similiar to reality, the model used can then be validated.
