\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

\par It was agreed by the members of the group that the main goal of the task proposed was achieved. As presented, both theoretical and simulation results(obtained using Octave tools and ngpsice simulator, in all its variants(operating, transient and frequency), respectively) matched, reaching total accuracy. Despite the initial belief that the considerable number of components of the circuit, and the number of steps needed to get to the final answer(the total solution),  could cause some disparity in the results, such did not happened.
\par To conclude, the model used can then be validated
