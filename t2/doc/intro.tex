% state the learning objective 
The aim of this laboratory work regarding the topics studied in the first three weeks of the course was to analyse a circuit constituted by an independent voltage source, an independent current source, a voltage controlled dependent current source, a current controlled dependent voltage source and seven resistors, as shown in the Figure 1 below.
 For this, a theorical analysis was made using both node and mesh methods, whose results will be discussed in Section 2. To validate these results, a simulation was conducted, as will appear in Section 3.


The results were then compared and the conclusions of the group summarized in Section 4.
