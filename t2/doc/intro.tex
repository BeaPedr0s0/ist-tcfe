\par The aim of this laboratory assignment is to analyse a RC circuit, which contains a sinusoidal voltage source $v_s$ and a capacitor $C$. The other components present in this four mesh circuit are 7 resistors (from $R_1$ to $R_7$) and a linearly dependent current $I_b$ and voltage $V_d$ sources.
\par The voltage controlled current source depends on the constant $K_d$ and the current controlled voltage source has a linear dependence on the constant $K_b$.

\par The voltage source varies in time as it follows:

\begin{equation}
v_s(t) = V_s u(-t) + sin(2 \pi f t)u(t)
\label {equation:n1}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
u(t)=e
\begin{cases}
0 & $t$ < $0$ \\
1 & $t $\geq$ 0$
\end{cases}
\label {eq:n2}
\end{equation}

\par The data generated automatically by the Python script is given in the table below.

\par The nodes (from $V_1$ to $V_8$) are displayed as it shows in Figure \ref{tab:initial_data}. The fourth node is considered to be the ground one.

The report is subdivided in three major sections.
\par The first, the theoretical analysis(\ref{section:theo}). This section adresses, sequencially, the nodal analysis, then the calculus of $R_eq$. With these results, the natural response of the circuit, the forced response are computed, and then superimposed. To finish, it is made a study of the frequency response of the circuit.
\par The second, the simulation analysis(\ref{section:sim}). In order to validate the results obtained in section \ref{section:theo}, operating point, transient and then frequency analysis are made.
\par The study of the circuit is concluded with a careful comparison between the results obtained using the different tools, in section \ref{section:comp}.
The conclusions of this study are outlined in the final section (\ref{section:con}).
