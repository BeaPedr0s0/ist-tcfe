\par The aim of this laboratory assignment is to analyse a RC circuit, which contains a sinusoidal voltage source $v_s$ and a capacitor $C$. The other components present in this four mesh circuit are 7 resistors (from $R_1$ to $R_7$) and a linearly dependent current $I_b$ and voltage $V_d$ sources.
\par The voltage controlled current source depends on the constant $K_d$ and the current controlled voltage source has a linear dependence on the constant $K_b$.

\par The voltage source varies in time as it follows:

\begin{equation}
	v_s(t) = V_s u(-t) + sin(2 \pi f t)u(t)
	\label {equation:n1}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	u(t)=e
	\begin{cases}
		0 & $t$ < $0$ \\
		1 & $t $\geq$ 0$
	\end{cases}
	\label {eq:n2}
\end{equation}

\par The nodes (from $V_1$ to $V_8$) are displayed as it shows in Figure \ref{fig:circ_inicial}. The fourth node is considered to be the ground one.

In Section 1, for $t < 0$, the voltage and the currents in all branches were determined with the node method. The circuit is analysed by simulations using the program Ngspice. In Section 2, both the equivalent resistor $R_eq$, seen from the capacitor terminals, and the nodes voltage were computed. An operating poin analysis is used to analyse the circuit when $t$ < $0$ and also to determine the time constant.The natural solution is determined in the interval [0, 20]ms in Section 3, followed in the next section with the computation of the forced solution.Both natural and forced solutions are computed with a transiet analysis. These solutions were superimposed. Phasors were converted to real time functions. In Section 6, the voltage ($v_c$, $V_s$ and $V_6$) responses due to variation of frequencies were studied. Theoretical analysis are made in all of the sections. Frequency analysis are also made. All the Ngspices simulations are compared with the theoretical results.
The conclusions of this study are outlined in the final section.
