\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

It was agreed by the members of the group that the main goal of the task proposed was achieved. As presented, both theoretical and simulation results(obtained using Octave tools and ngpsice simulator, respectively) matched, reatching total accuracy. Despite the initial belief that the considerable number of components of the circuit could cause some disparity in the results, such did not happened. 
This proves not only the efficency of both mesh and node methods to analyse the circuit, as well as the simulator used.
