\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

After careful evaluation of the Table~\ref{tab:op} below, which shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit that is being studied.This simulation allowed the group to obtain the current flowing in every risistor, the voltage in the dependent voltage source and even the current flowing in the dependent currrent source. 
\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
    \input{../sim/op_tab}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{NgSpice Results . A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
  \label{tab:op}
\end{table}

After comparing the results obtained in ngspice with the obtained using the octave math tools, we conclude that every result match.
