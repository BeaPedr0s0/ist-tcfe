\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

Ngspice was used to simulate the circuit in question. First of all, to contextualize the values obtained using this tool, it is necessary to state that, as node 0 is connected to ground, its nodal voltage does not appear on the table of results. Furthermore, to be able to describe the voltage flowing in the dependent source, an extra voltage source (whose voltage is equal to 0 V) was created, and put after the resistor 6 and node 6. This source led to the appearence of node 8, that has the same voltage of node 6. This was necessary because ngspice does not measure the current between two nodes, only in resistors and in independent voltage sources. The circuit with these changes is shown in the drawing below.

The simulated operating point results of the circuit that is being studied, allowed the group to obtain the current flowing in every resistor, the current in the dependent voltage source (IC) and even the current flowing in the dependent current source (IB). After running the simulation, the results were put in the table below.

  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
    \input{../sim/op_tab}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{NgSpice Results: A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current} and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
  \label{tab:op}
\end{table}

After comparing the results obtained in ngspice with the obtained using the octave math tools, analysed in Section 2, we conclude that every result, Ia,Ib and Ic match.
