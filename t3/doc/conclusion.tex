\section{Conclusion}
\label{con}

\par It was agreed by the members of the group that the main goal of the task proposed was achieved. As presented, both theoretical and simulation results(obtained using Octave tools and ngpsice simulator, including the output of the envelope detector, the output of the voltage regulator, the output voltage, the average and the ripple voltage matched, reaching total accuracy. Despite the initial belief that the considerable number of components of the circuit and the non-linearity of the diodes used to get to the final output voltage wanted, could cause some disparity in the results, such did not happened.
\par To conclude, the model used can then be validated.
