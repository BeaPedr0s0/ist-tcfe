\section{Conclusion}
\label{con}

\par As discussed in the introduction, the main goal of this assignment was to project an audio amplifier that allowed maximum voltage gain, spending the less possible on the components used. As so, both theorical analysis and simulation analyses were conducted. 

\par Despite strong efforts to match the results obtained in the different analysis, it was concluded that, due to the non-linearity of the components of the circuit, particularly the transistors, it was impossible to obtain the exact same quality using both tools. In fact, the complexity of the parameters of the transistors used in ngspice is believed to be the main reason for this outcome.

\par Nevertheless, once the ngspice model is the most similiar to reality, the model used can then be validated, dispate the discrepancies already explained.
